		<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;">As blockchain technology seeps further into almost every industry in the world — from government to supply chain to energy and entertainment — <br>
		there’s more to the decentralization phenomenon than algorithms, regulation, and code. Concurrent to all of that is the emergence of blockchain culture,<br>
		 the communities that create it, and a number of remarkable blogs and media outlets keeping up on all the happenings around the world.</p>
		<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;">Back in the days of Satoshi Nakamoto, blockchain was imbued with the culture of techno-libertarianism,<br>
	 	a community of people who wanted to live their lives outside of the control of governments and institutions, and looked towards technology to do so.<br>
		 As blockchain and digital currencies have become household names, the culture of blockchain has diffused into as many subcultures as their are cryptocurrencies!<br>
		So if you’re tired of the constant price speculation in sources like Reddit and the more mainstream crypto blogs, <br>
		here are some of our favorite sources for coverage of blockchain culture, written by those with their fingers on the pulse of the decentralization movement….</p></h3>

		<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;"><h3 style="color:WHITE;font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;">A must-read for any blockchain nerd, Evan Van Ness’ Week in Ethereum is all killer, <br>
		no filler, and refreshes weekly with a litany of bullet-pointed updates addressing the blockchain ecosystem from every angle. Whether you’re into protocol<br>
		 updates or the best blockchain editorial features, Week in Ethereum is a great place to download as much info as possible in the most streamlined fashion.

		<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;"><h3 style="color:WHITE;font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;">A recent addition to the blockchain blog milieu, Breaker Mag has made up for lost <br>
		time by exploding onto the scene with a wealth of in-depth features on blockchain and culture, and is setting the standard for actual journalism in the space.<br>
		 Breaker’s bullpen of seasoned and awarded writers dive deep into the nooks and crannies of this nascent blockchain culture to find the stories nobody else can.</h3></p>

		<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;"><h3 style="color:WHITE;font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;">	Although not exclusively a blockchain-centric blog, Hackernoon has become <br>
		something of a de facto blog of record for the burgeoning decentralization movement thanks to its hard pivot into covering the decentralization movement<br>
		 early on. Nowadays, about half of Hackernoon’s content is blockchain-related, and the outfit recently acquired the Crypto Disrupted podcast, <br>
		suggesting there’s a lot more to come.</h3></p>

		<article><h2 style="color:WHITE;font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;"><strong><u>Crypt0’s News</u></strong></h2>
		<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;"><h3 style="color:WHITE;font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;">An anomaly on this list as Crypt0’s News exists largely as a podcast<br>
		 and secondarily as a Steemit blog, but host Omar Bham’s relentless pursuit of blockchain news and information has resulted in a massive fanbase <br>
		 and up-close-and-personal access to major events like the launch of the GRMTK Token via Tokit and interviews with the most colorful figures <br>
		in the cryptocurrency space. Although the show covers price speculation, it’s always followed up by a healthy dose of blockchain and culture reporting,<br>
		 and Bham remains one of the most clued in commentators in the space.</h3></p>

		<p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;"><h3 style="color:WHITE;font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-style:italic;">As the editorial arm of ConsenSys, the ConsenSys Media blog has br
		the inside track on many of the world’s most exciting blockchain startups, but it’s also one of the only sources you’ll find personally written op-eds <br>
		by leaders of the blockchain movement, in-depth interviews with the technologists and entrepreneurs pushing the industry forward, and deep dives into<br>
		 how decentralization is changing the lives of people around the world.</h3></p>
