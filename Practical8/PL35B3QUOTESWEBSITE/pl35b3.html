            “Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. <br>
	The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're <br>
	not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them,<br>
	 disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.<br>
	 Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones,<br>
	 we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”
